Or, "Statically Updated Metadata Manifestation for Exherbo Repositories".

This is currently extremely crude. Patches encouraged.

Wish list:

* REMOTE_IDS

* Better deps display

* Links to git logs etc.

* Repo homepage should be a URI thing.

* Repo mask information

* Add in licences, and links to licences.

* Refactor some of the fairly common make / add methods into modules.

* Bug search URLs

* Link to the category from package pages.
