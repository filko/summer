Or, "Statically Updated Metadata Manifestation for Exherbo Repositories.

This is currently extremely crude. Patches encouraged.

Fix list:

* Some of the HTML we generate is invalid.

* Use those fancy non-breaking hyphens for package names too.

Wish list:

* Basic information about repositories, along with clickies for them in places
  like the versions table.

* REMOTE_IDS

* Links to packages (e.g. for deps) should have title='the summary'
